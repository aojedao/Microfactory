The machining module has two machines integrated in one model, the CNC and admission module.

The CNC machine was designed by [Julian Luna](https://github.com/juflunaca) and [Alejandro Ojeda](https://github.com/aojedao) for the Sensors and Actuators class at UNAL. You can view the design document in the following link.

## CNC 
* The machine has a 30 cm x 20 cm work area. 
* The machine mills using a Dremel 4000 
* Integrated [NerdFonts](www.nerdfonts.com) with 3000+ icons
* Automatic sitemap generation with [Jekyll Sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
* Configuration-free search engine optimization with [Jekyll Seo Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
* Reduced JavaScript usage to accelerate loading. No external js file for main frame (Some widgets require external JavaScript).
