# Scalability.

In manufacturing scalability is a word widely mentioned, but for this project, multiple definitions will be mentioned to create a consensus as for the scope the word will have in this project.

First, in software engineering, [Weinstock, C. B., & Goodenough, J. B. (2006)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA457003) from Carnegie Mellon University provided two definitions on their *On scalability* work.
  * Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload (without adding resources to a system). 
  * Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload by repeatedly applying a costeffective strategy for extending a system's capacity.

There is an agreement about the capacity to increase the workload as the most important factor in scalability.

Second, in manufacturing, [Wang, W., & Koren, Y. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612511000999?casa_token=nhV0Rkunoy0AAAAA:-_xp1ZxA12m9l_HI0K3EVAslML7pBHt_W0rB90kQYanyKialX09pmasyULZe7VeYNC1W0KxXHGQ) define scalability as the capability of manufacturing systems to adapt their throughputs to changing demands.

Similarly [Koren, Y., & Shpitalni, M. (2010)](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01891862/document) define scalability as the ability to easily modify production capacity by adding or subtracting manufacturing resources (e.g. machines) and/or changing components of the system.

Finally [Spicer, P., Yip-Hoi, D., & Koren, Y. (2005)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00268970500183042) state the following: 

> A basic concept of scalability in manufacturing systems is dated to the early 1980s (Browneet al.1984, Sethi and Sethi 1990, Abdel-Malek and Wolf 1993). At that time the term for scalability was expansion flexibility and this original term is found in flexible machine systems (FMS) literature.

> The specific definition given for scalability in Korenet al.(1998) is ‘the ability to adjust the production capacity of a system through system reconfiguration with minimal cost, in minimal time, over a large capacity range, at given capacity increments’.


Therefore our definition for scalability is:

Scalability is a system's or device's ability to modify their Key Performance Indicators (KPI) as a function of a set of controlled variables, such as size, module quantity, component quality, etc.
